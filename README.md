# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Library Management System.
# SRS (Procedure):
1.The Library Management System automates book and member management, issuing, and returns.
2.It ensures secure, reliable, and efficient record handling.
3.The SRS defines system functions, requirements, and user roles.
4.It includes six UML diagrams â€” Use Case, Class, Activity, package ,Communication, and sequence.
